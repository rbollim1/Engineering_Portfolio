## Summary

This project investigates how barnacle nauplii achieve propulsion in a low–Reynolds-number regime and translates their swimming kinematics into a mechanically actuated robotic model.  

I focused on correcting biological motion measurements, modeling appendage kinematics, and designing a mechanical stroke generation system capable of reproducing biologically accurate motion while operating at an equivalent Reynolds number.

**Core Contributions:**

- Re-measured appendage kinematics using joint-referenced angles  
- Modeled stroke dynamics as sinusoidal functions of time  
- Designed a mechanical transmission to replicate phase-offset appendage motion  
- Developed an experimental setup to match Reynolds number via fluid viscosity

## Problem and Constraints

Barnacle nauplii (Nauplius IV stage) swim at Reynolds numbers on the order of **Re ≈ 2**, where viscous forces dominate and inertia is negligible. In this regime:

- Reciprocal motion does not generate constant net propulsion  
- Stroke asymmetry and phase timing are essential  
- Scaling the organism up requires non-geometric similarity  

The project goal was to design a robotic analog that:
- Reproduces nauplius swimming kinematics
- Operates at an equivalent Reynolds number
- Fits within experimental tank and fabrication constraints

## Kinematic Modeling of Appendage Motion

Accurate mechanical replication required biologically meaningful measurements of appendage motion.

### Limitations of prior measurements

Previous measurements defined appendage angles relative to the **larval centroid**, rather than about each appendage’s hinge point. This introduced systematic error and obscured joint-level kinematics.

### Joint-referenced angle measurement

To correct this, I remeasured appendage angles directly about their hinge points using frame-by-frame image annotation in Photoshop. Reference axes were defined at each joint to extract true rotational motion.

### Sinusoidal modeling of appendage motion

The corrected joint angles were modeled as sinusoidal functions of time. This representation enabled:

- Explicit control of phase offsets between appendages  
- Adjustment of stroke amplitude and asymmetry  
- Direct translation into mechanical actuation constraints

## Mechanical Stroke Generation

The kinematic models informed the design of a mechanical transmission system capable of producing coordinated, phase-offset appendage motion.

The mechanism converts rotary input into controlled rotational motion at each appendage joint, enabling biologically inspired stroke timing.

### Control electronics

A custom PCB was designed to support synchronized actuation and power delivery for multiple appendages, enabling future closed-loop control and repeatable experimental trials.

## Physical Prototype Components

Structural components of the robot were 3D printed to validate form factor, internal volume constraints, and appendage mounting geometry.

## Matching Reynolds Number via Fluid Viscosity

Because the robotic model operates at a much larger scale than the biological larva, Reynolds number matching was achieved by increasing fluid viscosity rather than decreasing velocity alone.

A temperature-controlled water bath and capillary viscometer were used to characterize candidate fluids as a function of temperature.

## Completed Work and Project Results

Several planned next steps were completed during the project, resulting in a concrete experimental configuration.

### Completed work

- Designed robot chassis and electromechanical stroke system
- Completed viscosity–temperature characterization for multiple candidate fluids  
- Selected **corn syrup** as the working fluid based on its stable, tunable viscosity and ability to consistently achieve **Re ≈ 2** within the experimental temperature range  

Corn syrup provided a controllable viscous environment that allowed Reynolds number matching with relatively small thermal input requirements.

### Project Results

- After the robot was assembled, it was taken to the University of Washington to be used in marine biology research. 
- Robot successfully matched linear movement profile of recorded barnacle nauplii.
- Robot successfully matched calculated reynolds number conditions using average barnacle nauplii dimensions.
